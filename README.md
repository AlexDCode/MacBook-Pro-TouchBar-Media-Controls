# MacBook-Pro-TouchBar-Media-Controls
On new MacBooks with TouchBar, when you open a media app an extra button for media control appears along with 4 fixed shortcuts. But sometimes it does not appear. It is due to system killing "nowPlayingTouchUI" service which is responsible to control the extra button.
